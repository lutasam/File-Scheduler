This kit is a simplified version of bbfs by Joseph J. Pfeiffer, Jr., Ph.D.

The only difference is the automake build system has been replaced by a simple Makefile with no dependencies other
than pkg-config. The reliance on an autogenerated config.h has been removed. The idea is to make at easier base 
for students to start their own FUSE projects.

It was prepared by Tyler Bletsch at Duke University, 2020-07-30. It is based on the original bbfs dated 2018-02-04.
